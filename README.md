# Tipsy-App
Tipsy App - iOS App Design Pattern Challenge - I am one of the students of the App Brewery in the course, "iOS 14 &amp; Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp". This project is part of the exercises of the bootcamp. The goal of this challenge is to review some of the concepts learnt in the previous modules. Especially relating to the creation of multi-screen apps through the use of segues.

The goal of this challenge is to review some of the concepts learnt in the previous modules. Especially relating to the creation of multi-screen apps through the use of segues.

By the end of the module, you will have made beautiful bill splitting, tip calculating app. No one can work out $145.56 split between 5 people with a 20 percent tip. With your very own Tipsy app in hand, youâ€™ll never need to do maths ever again!
